## How it works
Two brushless ring motors spin stacked ring bevel gears. The ring bevel gears then transfer power to the central wheel. Differing speeds of the motors will cause the wheel to spin and change direction. For example spinning both motors at an equivalent speed in the same direction will cause the wheel to change direction. Spinning the motors in opposite directions will cause the wheel to spin in place.

## Motor design
I built a motor stator from forming layers of cheap laminated steel wire. I was able to create the metal part by 3d printing a three part mold and glued the layers in place with JB weld epoxy. The 54 teeth will later be wound with copper wire. The large number of teeth will provide better position controle and increased torque.

## Gear system
As explained before two beveled ring gears provide power to the wheel via an inner bevel gear. The second bevel gear is there to stabalize the axel. The outer diameter of the ring gears will be lined with magnets to form the inside of the motor. Additionaly the ring gears will be aligned using three thrust bearings in the central gap between the motor stators.
