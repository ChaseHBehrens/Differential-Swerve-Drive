# Differential Swerve Drive
A drive system built for robotic applications that allows for omnidirectional movement.

## How it works
Two brushless ring motors spin stacked ring bevel gears. The ring bevel gears then transfer power to the central wheel. Differing speeds of the motors will cause the wheel to spin and change direction. For example spinning both motors at an equivalent speed in the same direction will cause the wheel to change direction. Spinning the motors in opposite directions will cause the wheel to spin in place.
